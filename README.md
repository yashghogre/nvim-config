### My Neovim config

Just clone this repo in the `~/APPDATA/Local/nvim/` directory and run `nvim` in the terminal. The config is written in lua.

This nvim config has transparent background, so to use the transparent background, I run nvim on Alacritty terminal and set the background opacity to 0.8 through Alacritty config file.
